    "task_evaluation": "The task is to clean the table, suggesting the brush should be picked up in a way that allows its bristles to make contact with the table surface. A suitable approach would involve grasping the top part of the brush's handle, ideally toward the center to balance the brush and allow effective control during cleaning. The grasp should avoid the bristles to prevent damage and maintain effectiveness.",
