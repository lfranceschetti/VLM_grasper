The paintbrush is vertically oriented and is easily accessible from above. There is also a piece of paper or a cone-like object leaning against the brush within the cup.",
    "task_evaluation": "The task is to pick an object relevant for painting, which in this case is the red paintbrush. To pick the brush effectively, the best approach would be to grasp the handle firmly, close to the bristles at the top of the brush, to avoid damaging the bristles and to ensure a secure grip.",

    "reasoning": {
      "Green": "The green grasp position is low on the side of the mug, ideal for securely gripping the body and ensuring stability during pickup. It avoids interference with the mug's handle and provides a strong grip.",
      "Red": "The red grasp position is near the rim and slightly to the side. While it might provide a secure grip, it risks contact with the handle and might not be the best for stability.",
      "Blue": "The blue grasp seems to be near the top of the mug, parallel to the object inside. This position risks instability and might not securely hold the mug during lifting.",
      "Black": "The black grasp is positioned closer to the top of the mug, which is not optimal for stability. It could also interfere with the contents inside the mug.",
      "White": "The white grasp is at the rim of the mug, offering minimal contact area and risking the mug tipping during the lifting process."

Inside the mug, there is a cone-shaped object, possibly a piece of rolled paper. The mug is centrally located on the table, and five grasp points are indicated around it, each marked with a different color: Green, Red, Blue, Black, and White.",
    "task_evaluation": "The task requires picking up the mug, which means the grasp should secure the body of the mug effectively without causing it to tip or spill. The best approach is to secure the body of the mug, ideally from the side, ensuring a firm grip that allows it to be picked up without damaging the mug or its contents.",

    "reasoning": {
      "Green": "The Green grasp approaches from the side and would allow the gripper to comfortably hold the handle of the brush without damaging the bristles. It is suitably aligned with the goal.",
      "Red": "The Red grasp is directly above the paintbrush. While it provides a clear approach to grab the top of the handle, it might risk instability due to the vertical angle and presence of the cup.",
      "Blue": "The Blue grasp is at an angle from the right, which allows for stable handling of the paintbrush handle without interference with the bristles or the cup. This position is likely a good choice.",
      "Black": "The Black grasp is near the edge of the cup, making it a less suitable choice as it risks hitting the cup and is not close enough to the brush handle.",

Inside the cup, there is a paintbrush standing upright with the bristles facing upwards and the handle sticking into the cup. Various grasp positions are indicated around the paintbrush and cup: Green is on the left side of the brush, Red is above the brush, Blue is angled from the right side, Black is near the top right of the cup, and White is closer to the top left of the cup.",
    "task_evaluation": "To paint, the paintbrush needs to be used, so the task is to grasp the brush from a position that allows for easy handling. Grasping the handle near the top is preferable to prevent bristle damage. Approaching from the sides or above the cup is advisable to avoid collision with the cup.",
