            "Red": "The Red grasp is angled somewhat unfavorably, intersecting with the cone near the top. It risks pushing the top of the ice cream and lacks stability for holding the full weight from this angle.",

        "task_evaluation": "The goal is to pick up the ice cream. Given the upright orientation of the cone, the most effective grasp would likely target the cone portion from either side to ensure stability and prevent the top-heavy ice cream from tipping.",

            "Red": "The Red grasp is located near the top where the ice cream meets the cone. While still possible, it's less stable than the middle because it might risk tilting the ice cream off balance.",

The ice cream cone consists of a waffle cone base and a swirl of ice cream on top. The cone is in a vertical orientation with the pointed part of the cone on the bottom and the ice cream swirl facing upwards. There are three potential grasp positions marked with different colors around the ice cream.",
        "task_evaluation": "The task is to pick up the ice cream. Given its vertical orientation, a grasp around the cone part at the middle or slightly lower position would be favorable. This avoids contact with the top ice cream swirl, which is delicate. The grasp should ideally be from the side to securely hold the cone.",

            "Red": "The Red grasp is placed slightly lower on the cone compared to the Green grasp. While it can still achieve stability, it is further from the preferred gripping area and may risk a less secure hold.",
            "Blue": "The Blue grasp is positioned on the upper side, similar to Green but seems to come from a different angle. It closely aligns with the task but might be slightly less optimal given its angle, potentially requiring more adjustments."

The ice cream has a conical base with a rounded top representing the ice cream scoop. The cone is oriented vertically with the pointed end at the bottom and the ice cream scoop at the top.",
        "task_evaluation": "To pick up the ice cream, it would be ideal to grasp the cone itself just below the scoop, where the structure is most stable. This area is located at the top part of the cone, just under the ice cream. Given the object's vertical orientation, an approach from the side would be most effective.",
