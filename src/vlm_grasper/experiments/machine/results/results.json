    "reasoning": {
      "Green": "The Green grasp is located near the drill bit. Grasping here would not allow effective control of the drill for operation, as it is too close to the active drilling component.",
      "Red": "The Red grasp is around the handle area. This position is ideal because it allows for precise control during operation, ensuring stability and effectiveness while drilling.",
      "Blue": "The Blue grasp is also near the handle, but slightly higher than the Red. It might be adequate, but it may not provide as secure a grip as the Red grasp, which is centered on the handle.",
      "Black": "The Black grasp is on the main body of the drill. This position does not provide optimal control for drilling tasks since it's away from the handle.",
      "White": "The White grasp is close to the drill bit and shares the limitations of the Green grasp. It lacks the necessary leverage and control needed for using the drill."

    "scene_description": "The scene depicts a red electric drill placed on a white table. The drill is oriented with its handle and power cord toward the right side of the image, while the drill bit is pointed to the left. Five potential grasp positions are marked with different colors: Green and White grasps are near the drill bit, Black grasp is located on the main body of the drill, and Red and Blue grasps are around the handle area.",
    "task_evaluation": "The objective is to grasp the drill in a way that it can be effectively used to drill a hole. This generally involves gripping the handle securely to have control of the drill during operation.",
