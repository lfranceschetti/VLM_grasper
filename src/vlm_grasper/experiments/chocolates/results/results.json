    "task_evaluation": "Given the goal to select the healthier option, dark chocolate (CREMANT) is generally considered healthier than milk chocolate (LAIT) due to its higher cocoa content and lower sugar content. The best approach for grasping the CREMANT bar, considering its orientation, would be from the left or the top, ensuring the gripper does not come in contact with the table or damage the wrapper.",

It is positioned in a landscape orientation towards the right side of the table. The 'Cr\u00e9man' chocolate bar is closer to the top left corner, while the 'Lait' chocolate bar is closer to the top right corner.",
    "task_evaluation": "The task is to pick the healthier option. Typically, dark chocolate is considered healthier than milk chocolate as it usually contains less sugar and more cocoa, which has beneficial antioxidants. Thus, the 'Cr\u00e9man' bar is the healthier option. The ideal grasp to avoid damage or getting dirty would involve picking up the bar from the sides, specifically near its center.",
